                        <p>Hey there, reader! Before you dive in, let’s get one thing straight: this is a fictional
                            story. Any similarities to real people or situations are purely coincidental (or maybe you
                            just have really bad luck in love). If you’ve ever been a backup plan, an emotional support
                            system for someone “confused,” or told to “move on” right after getting attached—don’t
                            worry, you’re not alone. So, sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the drama. Just
                            remember: if they keep running back to their ex… you were never the main character.</p>

                    <p>Raghav was never that kind of man who had believed in love at first sight. He believed love was
                        something that developed over a period, something which required patience and understanding. But
                        then Sneha entered his life, and overnight, all his beliefs seemed so naive. She wasn't just
                        some girl in college; she was the type of girl who made a room light up if she was in it. Her
                        laughter tended to linger in his thoughts after she left. She was bright, quirky, and very, very
                        interesting. And totally out of reach.</p>

                    <p>She was dating someone.</p>

                    <p>The truth dawned on Raghav like a frosty wave, but he knew better than to linger on the
                        impossible. He told himself that friendship was enough. That late-night talks meant nothing more
                        than mutual companionship. That the smile she flashed him was simply her way of being friendly.
                        But destiny had other plans.</p>

                    <p>One morning, suddenly, she called him. Her voice was shaking. "Can we meet?"</p>

                    <p>He saw her and she looked… shattered. Her sparkle was gone, replaced by red, tear-streaming eyes
                        and a quivering voice.</p>

                    <p>"It's not working with Nigam," she stammered, and then, like that, she fell into his arms,
                        weeping.</p>

                    <p>Raghav held her, soothed her, promised her that everything would be alright. And in that instant,
                        something changed. Something he couldn't quite put his finger on, but it mattered. The
                        late-night talks grew longer. The texts came more often. The gap between them disappeared...</p>

                    <p>...Until one day she informed him that she had finally ended things with Nigam. That was when
                        Raghav felt it—hope. She held onto him now, laughed a little harder at his jokes, stayed a
                        little closer when they walked together. He felt special. Needed.</p>

                    <p>Then came the semester holiday. They decided to go back home together. Raghav even changed his
                        ticket to be with her. Within the compartment, curtains drawn, they talked endlessly. Then
                        suddenly, she said, "Nigam has been trying to reach me again."</p>

                    <p>Raghav's heart tightened. He smiled. "Then block him." She paused, nodded slightly, "There's no
                        need."</p>

                    <p>Those words felt like a knife. She saw his reaction and hugged him, whispering, "Please, Raghav…
                        let go. At home, let's not talk much. It'll help you move on."</p>

                    <p>Move on?</p>

                    <p>Their communication dwindled. Weeks passed. And then, on his birthday, she reappeared with a
                        smile and a gift. For Raghav, it reignited hope. But the flame was short-lived. At the mall, her
                        face changed. She saw Nigam.</p>

                    <p>She turned to Raghav, "Go. Now." He left, confused and heartbroken.</p>

                    <p>Later, she claimed blackmail. "Nigam has photos. I have to stay close to him to delete them."
                        Raghav chose to believe her, until she began deleting their chats from his phone. Then she
                        started shutting him out.</p>

                    <p>Blocked. Ignored. Gone.</p>

                    <p>Raghav contacted Ragini, their mutual friend. Ragini listened quietly and said she’d talk to
                        Sneha. Days passed. Panic attacks took over. Finally, Ragini called and met him.</p>

                    <p>She said softly, "Sometimes we keep searching for answers that are already in front of us."</p>

                    <p>"What do you mean?" Raghav asked.

                    <p>"She lied to you. No pictures. No blackmail. She was never going to pick you."</p>

                    <p>Just like that, the illusion shattered. Raghav had only been a moment of comfort. And some love
                        stories… aren’t meant to be written.</p>

                    <p><strong>You were never a choice—just a moment of comfort in their chaos.</strong></p>
